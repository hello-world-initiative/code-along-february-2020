# Love Calculator - Intro to JavaScript

These are the project files for a simple holiday card that you can share with friends and family. The design is very simple, so we'll be adding some animations to make things more interesting.

Check out a preview of what we'll be making here: [HWI Holiday Card](https://hwi-february-20.netlify.com/). Note that this page has not been optimized for mobile, so we recommend viewing it on a larger screen.

## Getting started

If you have `git` installed, you can clone this project using one of the URLs above:

```
git clone https://github.com/hello-world-initiative/code-along-february-2020.git

- or -

git clone git@github.com:hello-world-initiative/code-along-february-2020.git    # if you have SSH keys
```

If you don't have `git` installed, if you're using Windows and don't have `git-bash`, or you're not comfortable with `git` yet, you can download the files by clicking **Clone or Download** above, then choosing **Download ZIP**. Make sure you unzip the archive you download - your computer will probably have software that will let you do this.

## Files

This project comes with an `index.html` page, with a few styles pre-applied and images ready to use.

We'll be focusing on the `js/script-starter.js` file. A "finished" version can be found in `js/script-finished.js` to illustrate what we'll be working toward. 

To start working, look for this line in the `index.html` page:

```
<script defer src="js/script-finished.js"></script>
```

Change the script source to "js/script-starter" to remove the finished code and apply your own!
